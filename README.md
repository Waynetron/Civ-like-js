## Untitled Civ-like game

https://waynetron.github.io/Civ-like-js/

A hex based strategy game where the goal is to eliminate the other team.

Units are moved around in the top-down hex view. Similar to Civilisation or Advanced Wars.

When opposing units collide, the outcome is determined in a side-view battle, similar to Worms or Angry Birds.
